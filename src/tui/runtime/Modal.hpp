/// A @c ModalComponent is a self-contained interaction (a question, a picker, a
/// confirmation) that the runtime drives to a single @c Result. `runModal`
/// turns the hand-rolled "loop polling input until the prompt resolves" pattern
/// — duplicated across the agent auth flow, the AskUser prompt, and the
/// permission prompt — into one awaitable:
///
/// @code
/// auto answer = co_await runModal(runtime, question, &screen);
/// @endcode

/// Drives @p modal to completion on @p runtime, returning its result.
///
/// Each event is dispatched through @p screen first (so hover, tooltips, and
/// focus bookkeeping keep working) and then offered to `modal.step()`; the
/// screen is redrawn after every event the modal consumes. If the flow is
/// cancelled while awaiting input (Ctrl+C), the modal ends with std::nullopt,
/// matching the existing "Escape / cancelled" behavior.
///
/// The caller is responsible for placing @p modal in the screen tree (or as an
/// overlay) and for focus, before awaiting; `runModal` only drives the
/// interaction. Arguments are passed by pointer (not reference) because they are
/// coroutine parameters that outlive the suspension: the pointee must stay alive
/// for the whole call (see cppcoreguidelines-avoid-reference-coroutine-parameters).
///
/// @param runtime The runtime whose input the modal consumes (must outlive the call).
/// @param modal The interaction to drive (must outlive the call).
/// @param screen Optional screen to dispatch events through and redraw.
/// @return The modal's result, or std::nullopt if cancelled.
